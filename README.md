# Invaders-Must-Die-Android
A  tower defense developped in Android with AndEngine (created by Nicolas Gramlich).

An old school project that I recompiled with Android Studio. The application works pretty well (except soundtrack).
However, the code looks ugly and a refactoring is needed! :smile:

## How to build
Thanks to pre-compiled AndEngine libraries, the project is ready to build!
A specific NDK version could be needed.

## How to create maps
You can create map with the map editor [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). You can use the current map "assets/tmx/forest_map.tmx" for example.
